Original Apple II monitor code, ported to the unreleased Mattel Intellivision Keyboard Component

Back in 2003, I ported the original Apple II Monitor software to help me reverse-engineer the KC.  
The KC adds a 6502-based computer to the Intellivision Master Component.  I packaged the Apple II monitor
with a CP1610 bootloader, which I could load as an image using the standard Intellivision cartridge slot.

The first time around, I used a somewhat "modified" Intellicart to do this.  This was difficult to get to work.
I also used a build environment based on DOS-era tools.

This time around, I am using a stock Cuttle Cart 3, which can be used without mods on the KC system to load the software.
I am also planning to use more modern tools.

Status - not done yet! :)
